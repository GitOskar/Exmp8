# Own Data Structures Implementation
## Introduction
Repository contains few datastructures implemented by me. All of them are made in C++ and were a projects for my studies. Some of them may contain implementation of other data structures (I could not use standard template library) and other parts of code as I had to store everything for the project in one cpp file.
##B-Tree
Implementation of dictionary by B-Tree data structure.
##Red-Black tree
Implementation of dictionary by Red-Black tree data structure. Algorithm also contains implementation of double linked list.
##Fibonacci Heap
Implementation of priority queue by Fibonacci Heap data structure.
##Bipartite graph
Implemented to obtain the optimal solution to the algorithm problem.
##Compressed trie tree
Compressed trie tree implementation.
##Splay tree
Splay tree implementation
##Binary-Search-Tree
Implementation Binary-Search-Tree with all basic operations.
##Hash arrays
Own implementation of hash function and hash arrays for strings.
##Queue
Own implementation for a standard queue to obtain the optimal solution to the algorithm problem. Code also contains finding max in O(1).
##Double Linked Cycle List
Data structure implemented for a specific algorithm problem.
##Binary tree
Just building and displaying preorder.
